You will need to collect these items to escape: Rope, Shield,
Grappling Hook, Flashstone, and Broom. Without these items and
this note, you are surely doomed!

win_message = """ As you enter the room you see the terrible Red Dragon
across the chasm breath in and blast his molten breath
in your direction! You quickly raise your shield and
narrowly avoid incineration. He breathes in, preparing
another attack, giving you a split second with which to
hurl the flashstone before his eyes. It explodes, blinding
the wyrm. You quickly search for a grapple point so
you can swing across the wide chasm, but can't find
anything besides a small recess that once held a torch.
Thinking quickly you aim the broom for it, and by what
could only be described as divine providence, your aim
is true. As quickly as you can, you use it to swing 
to the other side before as the cursing dragon begins to
regain his vision. Thankfully, the door to your freedom
is within reach, and you escape to live another day."""
