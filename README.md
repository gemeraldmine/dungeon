# Untitled Dungeon Project for University

This is a very basic text-based dungeon game for Introduction to Scripting that
will involve moving between rooms and collecting items before moving onto the
final dragon room.

So far I have room movement and item pick up and inventory
display running.

TODO:

- [ ] Finish rooms, with descriptions and items
- [ ] Write final room logic

## Constraints

- [ ] There must be a minimum of eight rooms.
- [ ] Each room must contain one item, with the exception of the “start” room and
the room containing the villain.
- [x] The “start” room is where players will begin their moves and should not
contain any items.
- [ ] The room containing the villain should not contain any items.

## Ask myself

- [ ] What are the different steps needed in this program?
- [ ] How might you outline them in a way that a computer can understand?
- [x] What information would you need from the player at each point (inputs)?
- [x] What information would you output to the player at each point?
- [x] When might it be a good idea to use “IF” and “IF ELSE” statements?
- [x] When might it be a good idea to use loops?
- [x] When might it be a good idea to use functions (optional)?

## Pseudocode for moving between rooms

- [x] What input do you need from the player? How will you prompt the player for
that input? How will you validate the input?
- [x] What should the program do if the player enters a valid direction? What
output should result?
- [x] What should the program do if the player enters an invalid direction? What
output should result?
- [x] How will you control the program flow with decision branching and loops?

## Pseudocode for collecting items

- [x] What input do you need from the player?
- [x] How will you prompt the player for that input?
- [x] How will you validate the input?
- [x] What should the program do if the player enters a valid item (the item in
their current room)? What output should result?
- [x] What should the program do if the player enters an invalid item (an item
not in their current room)? What output should result?
- [x] How will you control the program flow with decision branching or loops?
