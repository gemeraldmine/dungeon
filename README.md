# Untitled Dungeon Project for University

This is a very basic text-based dungeon game for Introduction to Scripting that will involve moving between rooms and collecting items before moving onto the final dragon room.

## Constraints:
There must be a minimum of eight rooms.
Each room must contain one item, with the exception of the “start” room and the room containing the villain.
The “start” room is where players will begin their moves and should not contain any items.
The room containing the villain should not contain any items.

## Ask myself:
What are the different steps needed in this program? How might you outline them in a way that a computer can understand?
What information would you need from the player at each point (inputs)? What information would you output to the player at each point?
When might it be a good idea to use “IF” and “IF ELSE” statements?
When might it be a good idea to use loops?
When might it be a good idea to use functions (optional)?

## Pseudocode for moving between rooms:
What input do you need from the player? How will you prompt the player for that input? How will you validate the input?
What should the program do if the player enters a valid direction? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters an invalid direction? What output should result?
How will you control the program flow with decision branching and loops?

## Pseudocode for collecting items:
What input do you need from the player? How will you prompt the player for that input? How will you validate the input?
What should the program do if the player enters a valid item (the item in their current room)? What output should result?
What should the program do if the player enters an invalid item (an item not in their current room)? What output should result?
How will you control the program flow with decision branching or loops?
